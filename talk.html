            <h1>Charles Babbage</h1>
            <p>
              Born in 1791, Babbage is known for inventing the digital computer.
            </p>
            <p>
              The computers he created were quite different to modern computers.
              These computers were <b>mechanical</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Computers back then were <b>people</b>. A common task these
              "computers" had was to create mathematical tables by hand. These
              mathematical tables were therfore expesnive to produce and
              sometimes had minor inaccuracies.

              One of Babbage's first computers was the <b>Difference Engine</b>.
              This had instruction based processing and the control unit. This
              machine was able to tabulate (onto sheets) polynomial functions.
            </p>
            <p>
              He only managed to produce a protype at the time however since
              funding fell through. All difference engines operational today are
              replicas.

            <h1>Analytical Engine</h1>
            <p>
              This mechanical computer by Babbage was programmed using
              <b>punch cards</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was able to use it's previous output as an input to its next
              calculation and was in principle turing-complete
            </p>
            <p>
              However just like his preivous project, this device was left
              unfinished due to innadequate funding

              The fundamentals of modern computing stem back from the invention
              of boolean algebra.

              <b>George boole</b>, the First Professor of Mathematics at UCC is

            <p>
              He proposed that all mathematical operations can be represented
              using the following basic operations:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>AND</li>
              <li>OR</li>
              <li>NOT</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>
              This abstraction paved the way for the implementation of
              processors that allow us to compute in the modern era

            <p>
              The US Navy wanted to construct a more accurate torpedo for
              underwater conflict. They decided to make what would be know as an
              electromechanical computer.

              The computer was small enough to be loaded onto a torpedo. It
              tracked the position of the target and computed the angle that the
              torpedo had to go at.

            <h1>ENIAC</h1>
            <p>This is the first general purpose turing-complete computer</p>
            <p>
              It consisted of 20x10 digit signed accumulators (result register),
              ring counters (made of vacuum tubes to store digits) and IO
              through IBM punch cards.
            </p>
            <p><b>Yes it used base 10</b></p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                It had the ability to even do floating point arithmetic with
                double precision (it was jerry rigged though).
              </li>
              <li>
                It's original programmers consisted of Kay McNulty, Betty
                Jennings, Betty Snyder, Marlyn Meltzer, Fran Bilas, and Ruth
                Lichterman (all women)
              </li>
              <li>
                It's first use case was to compute test simulations of the
                hydrogen bomb. Used 1 million cards for this. (this first large
                codebase)
              </li>
              <li>Later revision of this became the EDVAC</li>
